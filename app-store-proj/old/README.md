# app-store-proj

Data project simulating a situation where we are data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps.

## About

The old version of this project (in the `old` folder) was done as a guided project for Dataquest.  In this project I applied what I learned about beginner Python coding, including reading in CSV files to lists, writing functions, using lists, loops, and conditional statements.  I also learned some basics for data cleaning as well as data storytelling.  As my first project it's rough around the edges and needs some cleaning up!

## Files

The two datasets used are included in the folder and explained in a markdown cell in each set.  The datasets were originally downloaded from Kaggle and cleaned up a bit by the Dataquest staff for learning purposes.
